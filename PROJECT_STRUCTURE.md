3. **Component Isolation**: Changes to one page don't affect others
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new features and pages
5. **Modern React**: Uses functional components with hooks

## Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: up to 768px
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px  
- **Desktop**: 1024px and above

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Future Android Conversion

The app is built with mobile-first principles and uses:
- Responsive design suitable for mobile screens
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- PWA-ready structure
- React Native compatibility considerations

For Android conversion, consider:
- React Native
- Capacitor for hybrid app development
- PWA with app-like features

## Color Scheme

- **Primary**: #667eea (Blue gradient start)
- **Secondary**: #764ba2 (Purple gradient end)
- **Background**: #f4f7fa (Light blue-gray)
- **Text**: #333 (Dark gray)
- **Accent**: Various mood-based colors

## Technology Stack

- **React** (Functional Components + Hooks)
- **React Router** (Navigation)
- **CSS3** (Custom styling with flexbox/grid)
- **ES6+** (Modern JavaScript)

The project structure ensures that each feature is modular and maintainable, making it easy to extend and modify individual components without affecting the entire application.
